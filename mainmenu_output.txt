We started in the year 1961 in a small garage as a car rental business in the national capital New Delhi.
We initially bought two HM Ambassadors as an investment and the car was a big hit amongst the politicians and upper middle-class people in the country.
Initially, our comprehension of a full length business model was minimal. Our primary model was based on experimental analysis and trial and error. As the business grew, we realised that a solid model had to be put into place.So we decided to take our company to the next level
It was in the 1965 we bougth three more cars which were two Premier Padminis and one Morris Minor (A British car manufacturer). Eventually our business expanded. We started getting more customers who could pay well for the imported vehicles.
On an auspicious day in the year 1967, a man came to us with a request to buys his car ( A two years old Ambassador). He was shifting to abroad and did not required the car. We thougth for some time and bought that car. The car we bougth had not been serviced fot more than a year and had some scratches as well.
The car was being repaired by our men when came a youngster who was a relative of the man who sold us that car. He said that he wishes to buy that car and we were making some profit too. It was that day when we got the idea of opening a pre-owned car buy and sell business in stream with our previous business.
In the year 1975 our both the businesses were doing well when we decided to open a new business of car repairing which contined till the end of the twentieth century.
In the year 1980 we observed that the pre-owned car business was doing better than the rental business so we decided to do away with the car rental business and sold our thirty five cars which we had at that time for rental purpose.
We had got enough funds at that time to start selling some brand new cars also which were imported from foreign countries,some of the brands being Jaguar, Alpha-Romeo, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz,etc. This made it easier for those people who thougth of buying exotic cars.
By the start of the twenty-first century we had opened 3 branches of our company in the major parts of our country like Mumbai and Chandigarh.
Now, in the year 2020 we have a lineup of 19-20 cars best of their kinds to buy in each branch and more than 50 cars coming each day for selling.
